# CGPA-Calculator
#** CGPA Calculator in C++**<br/>

#(Overview)<br/>

This project is a simple CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) calculator written in C++.
It is designed to help students easily calculate their GPA and CGPA based on the grades and credit hours of their courses. 
The calculator supports a wide range of grades, from "A+" to "F," and computes the GPA by taking into account the credit hours of each course.<br/>

#Features<br/>

Grade Conversion: The program can convert letter grades (A+, A, B+, B, etc.) into grade points.
GPA Calculation: Computes the GPA for a given semester based on the grades and credit hours of courses.
CGPA Calculation: If used for multiple semesters, it can calculate the CGPA by averaging the GPAs of all semesters.
Input Validation: Ensures that only valid grades are entered, prompting the user to re-enter if an invalid grade is provided.
Simple and Beginner-Friendly: The code is written in a straightforward manner, making it easy to understand and modify for beginners.<br/>

#How to Use<br/>
